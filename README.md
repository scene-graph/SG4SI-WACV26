# SG4SI-WACV26
Workshop of Scene Graph for Structural Intelligence (SG4SI) @ WACV26


## Call for Papers
We invite original research contributions in (but not limited to) the following areas:
- **Scene Graph Generation**, methods for constructing scene graphs from images, videos, 3D/4D, and
panoptic scenes, including structured modeling, long-tail relation handling, and multi-modal fusion.
- **Scene Representation Learning**, advances in learning unified, scalable, and transferable scene representations, covering self-supervised learning, contrastive approaches, cross-modal alignment, and
integration with large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
- **Scene Graph for Downstream Applications**, leveraging structured scene representations for tasks
such as image / video generation, visual question answering, spatial reasoning, robotic navigation, ...
- **Scene Graph Benchmark and Evaluation**, design of new benchmarks, and metrics for scene graph
quality, cross-modal grounding, reasoning ability, controllability, and generalization across domains.

This repository is regularly updated and provides valuable resources for your submission.

## Submission Guidances
We welcome the submission of long, short, and demo papers. Long papers may include up to 8 pages
of content (excluding references), while short and demo papers may include up to 4 pages plus references.
Authors will be asked to indicate the paper type and whether they wish their submission to appear in the
workshop proceedings; we particularly encourage long papers to be included. All papers must be written in English, follow the double-blind review process, and conform to the WACV formatting guidelines
(templates available on the WACV website).
